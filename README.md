### Test task
Write a form application to create a **TODO** task list, where the control styles and markup should roughly match the layout.
You can use the default styles of radio buttons and checkboxes.

#### The form consists of the following elements:
1. Task addition area (input field and Add button)
2. Task list area with checkboxes for completion and icons for deleting a task
3. The filter field by task status, consisting of a group of radio buttons: All/Active/Completed. Everything is by default.
4. The field of the task sorting type, consisting of a drop-down list with two options: Name and Status. The default is the Name.

#### Additional. Conditions:
1. To implement list state management using react-redux or redux toolkit (RTK)
2. Customize the styles of the Add button:

- when hovering the mouse (hover), its color should be lighter

### Start:
#### ```yarn``` 
#### ```yarn dev``` or ```vite dev```
